This is the official quantitative and statistical software package by Yin's Capital. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the logical extension of human will. At Yin's Capital, we investigate marketable securities through not only the lens of human experience but also by machine power to discover the undiscovered intrinsic value of securities.

The above codes navigate through over 100 stocks and screen for the ones with the predicted return to be higher than threshold. In addition, I also share the following which includes a narrower pool of stocks to screen from.
